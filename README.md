🔑 Basic Authentication Project

🌟 Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of basic authentication mechanisms in backend development. It includes features like user registration, login, and session management, focusing on secure handling of user credentials.

🛠️ Technologies Used

🚀 Node.js (Express)

🗃️ MongoDB (Mongoose)

🔐 JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

🧂 bcrypt for password hashing

🌟 Features

📝 User Registration: Create a new account with a username and password.

🔑 User Login: Authenticate using valid credentials.

🔒 Protected Routes: Access restricted content after login.

🔑 Password Hashing: Securely store user passwords.

🪙 JWT Token Generation: Issue tokens upon successful login.

🛡️ Token Verification: Verify the authenticity of tokens on protected routes.

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basic-authentication.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd basic-authentication

Install dependencies:

npm install

🚀 Usage

Start the server:

npm start

Access the application at:

http://localhost:3000

📡 API Endpoints

POST /register - Register a new user.

POST /login - Authenticate and receive a token.

GET /protected - Access a protected resource (requires valid token).

🔧 Environment Variables

PORT - Port number for the server (default: 3000)

JWT_SECRET - Secret key for signing tokens

DB_URI - MongoDB connection string

📚 Learning Outcomes
